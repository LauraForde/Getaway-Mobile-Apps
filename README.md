## Getaway  
I decided that this being my final year doing mobile apps I would do something I had not done before, make a game using Unity. I have always enjoyed playing games that involved collecting coins since I was young. Getaway was what I decided upon. It is a man used to snow, as he is wearing a snow jacket, running through a desert to pick up coins. I wanted to add fireballs into the game but because I managed time incorrectly between college and working part-time in retail at the weekends my college work suffered. I followed YouTube tutorials on the [gamesplusjames](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyBsvsU7uiurMiBZIYXvnyg) chanel to get used to Unity and all it's tricks. This app is made for any Windows device so download and play Getaway!!
